	- ATTENTION! You no longer need to use XML::RSS::Feed::Factory
	  to defined 'feeds', just pass an array ref of hash refs 
	  for each feed you'd like to watch.
	- Fixed POD example so it actually works :D
	- added 'tmpdir' param to pass to XML::RSS::Feed objects to 
	  cache XML on DESTROY and to attempt to load and parse old
	  headlines when the object is initialized.
	- added 'feed' accessor method to fetch XML::RSS::Feed objects

0.10
	- Now use XML::RSS::Headline instead of XML::RSS::Feed::Headline
	- added an accessor 'feeds' for to the hash of rss feeds

	  support of adding, reloading, removing feeds.
